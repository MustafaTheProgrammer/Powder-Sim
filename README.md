# Powder-Sim
A basic powder Sim I programmed. This has 3 types: stone, water, and sand. You can move the cursor and place entities. This was my first Java Ascii program after my 2 month hiatus which started in October. There's also now a .class file, so no need to compile then run the .java file, you can just run the .class file.
